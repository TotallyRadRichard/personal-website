Hi, I'm Richard. I am a web developer, programmer, content creator, and extreme lover of movies. This is my website. For more information check out this post.

I built this place to help share my experiences and provide information about myself. I talk about code mostly but you never know with me. Over time it's content evolves, but it will always be a place to spy on what is going on in my world.

It's meant to be simple and as distraction free as possible. Occasionally I add new features and pages when needed, but I try to keep it to a minimum. Posts are a lot more common.

So take a look around, follow me on Twitter for the latest updates, and I hope you enjoy my site.
